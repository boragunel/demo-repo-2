Basically, the point of this file was to use git status to show that you have
a tracked and also an untracked file.
to tell git to track this file, you need to use 'git add'
if you want to add all the files in the directory, you say 'git add .'
The dot on the line refers to every point


git commit -m "Added index.html" -m "some description"
This is the code you use on terminal for commiting.
The -m means it is the message, it is required to commit the files
The first -m is for the title and the second is for the description
The code given only saves it locally.

To make the commit live, you use git push
To make this happen, you need to convince github that
you are the owner of the account. You do this by using
SSH key commands,
so the main command is -t rsa -b 4096 -C "email@example.com"
ssh-keygen command used for pushing
You specify the type of encryption '-t rsa'
you specify the strength of encryption -b 4096
Then you include the github email linked to your github
-C "email@example.com"

Once this is done 'Batman' was the name of the SSH key
and once you do 'git grep Batman'
and also, git grep Batman.pub
it summons the key as a file on the current directory

From then on you need OpenSSH and SSH agent downloaded and you need
do this in these steps:
1. Run you current terminal as administrator
2. Use the following commands on the windows powershell terminal:
# Install the OpenSSH Client
Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Client~~~~0.0.1.0
# Install the OpenSSH Server
Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Server~~~~0.0.1.0
# Start the sshd service
Start-Service sshd

# OPTIONAL but recommended:
Set-Service -Name sshd -StartupType 'Automatic'

# Confirm the Firewall rule is configured. It should be created automatically by setup. Run the following to verify
if (!(Get-NetFirewallRule -Name "OpenSSH-Server-In-TCP" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select-Object Name, Enabled)) {
    Write-Output "Firewall Rule 'OpenSSH-Server-In-TCP' does not exist, creating it..."
    New-NetFirewallRule -Name 'OpenSSH-Server-In-TCP' -DisplayName 'OpenSSH Server (sshd)' -Enabled True -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -Action Allow -LocalPort 22
} else {
    Write-Output "Firewall rule 'OpenSSH-Server-In-TCP' has been created and exists."
}


In order to connect to OpenSSH server you need to write the following commands on terminal
ssh domain\username@servername
If you have Git Bash, the following information can automatically be recognized.

To then start the SSH agent, you need to use the following code:
Start-Service ssh-agent
ssh-add <the directory of the ssh key>
You add a passphrase to your key (which will not appear on the terminal)
you then write the code:
ssh-add -l
to list the identities that are currently loaded to the ssh agent

origin is the location of the git repository
master is the branch we want to push
